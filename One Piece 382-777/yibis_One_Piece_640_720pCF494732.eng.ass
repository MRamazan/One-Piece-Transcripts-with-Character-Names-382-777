The first one is "yousei" which I've been translating as 'fairy' and the second one is "kobito" which I'm translating as 'dwarf'. I guess the only problem is that when I hear the word dwarf, I think of short and stumpy like Gimmly from Lord of the Rings. So if someone has a better term to use for this word, then I'm fine with it, but I'd like to keep the distinction between the 2 words as they distinguish between the imaginations of the people ("yousei"'fairy') and the truth about them ("kobito"'dwarf')}
