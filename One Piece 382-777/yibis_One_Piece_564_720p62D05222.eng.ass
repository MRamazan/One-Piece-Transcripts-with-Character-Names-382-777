Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.33,0:21:12.27,Main,Ikaros,0000,0000,0000,,Geso! { tlc: There's a missing line where Ikaros says "Geso!" here.  It's just a yell, but this particular yell is the name of a type of squid-leg sushi.  Of course, most of Icaros's yells/sayings/etc. have some relation to squid cuisine...}{ def: we could include a tl note here }{Starfish: Is this really even necessary to include at all? I mean, it's just a random exclamation that isn't even on-screen for one second, and I rather doubt the fans would go "OH MY GAWD WHAT DID IKAROS SAY THERE I AM SO CONFUSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111one" if we left it out either. And including a TL-note for a random exclamation that isn't even on-screen for one second strikes me as kind of... pointless.}
