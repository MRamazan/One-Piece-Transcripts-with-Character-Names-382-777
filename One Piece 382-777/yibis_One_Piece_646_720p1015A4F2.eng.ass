Apparently it's a pun, wherein if one reads the kanji ("gihaio" in reverse order, it becomes "oihagi", which is his nickname that we're translating as "Bandit". So the joke is that since he's throwing the weapons he stole back at Luffy, he's sort of giving them back, which is the opposite of what a bandit does... so the attack-name is "bandit" backwards. As for how to deal with this... I can't really think of a better way of putting it than what's already there. I mean, a charitable donation IS about as far removed from plundering as you can get. -Starfish}
